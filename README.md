Make Kasarmiina Great Again!

You buy some lunch, you eat it, you throw away what's left. Sounds familiar? Food waste is an increasing problem in food service industry which leads to major problems, starting with increased costs and waste and ending in famine.

WASTED app can help you fight the injustice by making the process of throwing away leftover food more **entertaining** and **profitable** for users!

The idea is to add a reward system:
- Weigh the tray at the waste station to measure the mass of the leftover food
- Thow it away and get points
- The less food you dispose of, the more points you get
- Spend points on rewards (lunch discount, free coffee, bagels etc.)

Be responisble, get WASTED
