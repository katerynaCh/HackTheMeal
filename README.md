Make Kasarmiina Great Again!

You buy some lunch, you eat it, you throw away what's left. Sounds familiar? Food waste is an increasing problem in food service industry which leads to major problems, starting with increased costs and waste and ending in famine.

WASTED app can help you fight the injustice by making the process of throwing away leftover food more **entertaining** and **profitable** for users!

The idea is to extend the Smartmeal system add a reward system:
- Weigh the tray at the waste station to measure the mass of the leftover food
- Thow it away and get points
- The less food you dispose of, the more points you get
- Be alerted when your portion is getting bigger than usual
- Earn points by achieving your calorie goals
- Spend points on rewards (lunch discount, free coffee, bagels etc.)

With WASTED, while saving the planet, businesses also save money.
For MAMK, this will result in huge cost benefits: providing several rewards is cheaper than waste disposal. 
For Smartmeal owners, high amount of users will result in popularity of the system and sales increase.
For users, discounts will be provided as results.

<h3>Be responisble. Get WASTED.</h3>
